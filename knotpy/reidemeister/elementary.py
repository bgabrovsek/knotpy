    {old_endpoint_1: new_endpoint_1, old_endpoint_2: new_endpoint_2}.

    For example, if the dictionary is {a0i: b0, c1o: d2}, in the diagram node incidency, the following changes are made:
    a[c1o,...], c[...,a0i,...] is changed to b[d2o,...], d[...,...,b0i,...] (attributes are copied from key to value).
    The endpoints of a and c are not removed and stay as they were (unless overwritten by another dict).

    Keys must be Endpoint objects, values should be endpoint pairs.

    Method is non-stable (can damage the realizability of the diagram).
